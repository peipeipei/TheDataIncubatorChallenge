For this analysis, I used the Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017‚Äù, accessed from https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017 on July 17th, 2018. 

```{r}
aisles <- read.csv("instacart_2017_05_01/aisles.csv")
departments <- read.csv("instacart_2017_05_01/departments.csv")
order_products__prior <- read.csv("instacart_2017_05_01/order_products__prior.csv")
order_products__train <- read.csv("instacart_2017_05_01/order_products__train.csv")
orders <- read.csv("instacart_2017_05_01/orders.csv")
products <- read.csv("instacart_2017_05_01/products.csv")
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2) 
library(reshape2)
```



```{r}
ggplot(orders, aes(x = days_since_prior_order)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(x = "Days Since Prior Order",
       y = "Count",
       title = "Distribution of Orders by Days Since Prior Order") +
  geom_bar(fill = c("red", rep("grey25", 6), 
                    "red", rep("grey25", 6), 
                    "red", rep("grey25", 6),
                    "red", rep("grey25", 6),
                    "red", "grey25", "red"))
```

```{r}
ggplot(orders[as.numeric(orders$days_since_prior_order) == 0, ], 
       aes(x = order_hour_of_day)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Hour of Day",
       y = "",
       title = "Hour of day when days since prior order = 0")
```

```{r}
same_day_order <- which(orders$days_since_prior_order == 0)
prev_same_day <- same_day_order - 1
same_day_hours <- orders[same_day_order,]$order_hour_of_day - orders[prev_same_day,]$order_hour_of_day


ggplot(data.frame(same_day_hours), aes(x = same_day_hours)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Hours Since Last Order",
       y = "",
       title = "Hours Since Last Order if Ordered on the Same Day")

```


```{r}
ggplot(orders, aes(x = order_hour_of_day)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = c(rep("grey25", 10), "red", rep("grey25", 4), "red", rep("grey25", 8))) +
  labs(x = "Hour of the Day",
       y = "",
       title = "Distribution of Orders by Hour of the Day")
```
